## SDL4Wolf libretro WIP port by Wolf3s
SDL4Wolf is an open-source port/core of id Software's classic first-person shooter
Wolfenstein 3D. based on The [Wolf4SDL](https://github.com/Doom-modding-and-etc/Wolf4SDL) which the purpose is convert/remove all the SDL Functions to the vanilla Wolfenstein 3d
It is meant to try to keep the original feel while taking advantage of some improvements mentioned in the list below.

Main features:
--------------
 - Cross-platform:
      Supported operating systems are at least:
       - Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista
         (32 and 64 bit), Windows 7 (32 and 64 bit), Windows 10 (32 and 64 bit)
       - Linux
       - BSD variants
       - Mac OS X (x86) Only little endian platforms like x86, ARM and SH-4 are currently supported.
	   
 - AdLib sounds and music:
      This port includes the OPL2 emulator from MAME, so you can not only
      hear the AdLib sounds but also music without any AdLib-compatible
      soundcard in near to perfect quality!

 - Multichannel digitized sounds:
      Digitized sounds play on 8 channels! So in a fire fight you will
      always hear, when a guard opens the door behind you ;)

 - Higher screen resolutions:
      Aside from the original 320x200 resolution, SDL4Wolf currently
      supports any resolutions being multiples of 320x200 or 320x240,
      the default being 640x400.
      Unlike some other ports, SDL4Wolf does NOT apply any bilinear
      or similar filtering, so the graphics are NOT blurred but
      pixelated just as we love it.

 - Fully playable with only a game controller:
      SDL4Wolf can be played completely without a keyboard. At least two
      buttons are required (shoot/YES and open door/NO), but five or more
      are recommended (run, strafe, ESC).
	  
Additional features:
--------------------
 - Two additional view sizes:
      SDL4Wolf supports one view size using the full width of the screen
      and showing the status bar, like in Mac-enstein, and one view size
      filling the whole screen (press TAB to see the status bar).

 - (Nearly) unlimited sound and song lengths:
      Mod developers are not restricted to 64kB for digitized sounds and
      IMF songs anymore, so longer songs and digitized sounds with better
      quality are possible.

 - Resuming ingame music:
      When you come back to the game from the menu or load a save game, the
      music will be resumed where it was suspended rather than started from
      the beginning.

 - Freely movable pushwalls:
      Moving pushwalls can be viewed from all sides, allowing mod developers
      to place them with fewer restrictions. The player can also follow the
      pushwall directly instead of having to wait until the pushwall has left
      a whole tile.

 - Optional integrated features for mod developers:
      SDL4Wolf already contains the shading, directional 3D sprites,
      floor and ceiling textures, high resolution textures/sprites,
      parallax sky, cloud sky and outside atmosphere features, which
      can be easily activated in version.h.
	  
 - Toggle Screen Feature:
	  SDL4Wolf can toggle into fullscreen if you press ALT+ENTER

The following versions of Wolfenstein 3D data files are currently supported
by the source code (choose the version by commenting/uncommenting lines in
version.h as described in that file):

 - Wolfenstein 3D v1.1 full Apogee
 - Wolfenstein 3D v1.4 full Apogee
 - Wolfenstein 3D v1.4 full GT/ID/Activision
 - Wolfenstein 3D v1.4 full Imagineer (Japanese)

How to play:
------------
To play Wolfenstein 3D with SDL4Wolf, you just have to copy the original data
files (e.g. ``.WL6``) into the same directory as the SDL4Wolf executable.
Please make sure, that you use the correct version of the executable with the
according data files version as the differences are hardcoded into the binary!

For now:
SDL1.2:
On Windows SDL.dll and SDL_mixer.dll must also be copied into this directory.
SDL 1.2.15 Runtimes can be acquired at: 
https://github.com/wolfysdl/SDL-Archive/raw/main/SDL-1.2.15-win32.zip and download "SDL-1.2.15-win32.zip"

SDL_mixer 1.2.12 Runtimes can be acquired at:
https://github.com/wolfysdl/SDL_mixer-archive/raw/main/SDL_mixer-1.2.12-win32.zip and download "SDL_mixer-1.2.12-win32.zip"

or

SDL2:
On Windows SDL2.dll and SDL2_mixer.dll must also be copied into this directory.

SDL2 2.0.24 Runtimes can be acquired at:
https://github.com/wolfysdl/SDL-Archive/raw/main/SDL2-2.24.0-win32-x86.zip and download "SDL_mixer-2.0.24-win32.zip"

SDL_mixer 2.0.4 Runtimes can be acquired at:
https://github.com/wolfysdl/SDL_mixer-archive/raw/main/SDL2_mixer-2.6.2-win32-x86.zip and download "SDL_mixer-2.0.4-win32.zip"

! ATTENTION ! Do NOT download the x64 version of SDL or SDL_mixer. x86 binairies are required.

If you play in windowed mode (--windowed parameter), press SCROLLLOCK or F12
to grab the mouse. Press it again to release the mouse.

Compiling from source code:
---------------------------

The current version of the core source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/libretro/libretro-wolfenstein3d)

The following ways of compiling the source code are supported:
 - Makefile.libretro
 
To compile the source code you need(For now) the development libraries of
[SDL](https://github.com/wolfysdl/SDL-Archive) or [SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-2.24.0) and
[SDL_mixer](https://github.com/wolfysdl/SDL_mixer-archive) or [SDL2_mixer](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_mixer/releases/tag/release-2.6.2)

Warning: pick the devel version

Deprecated links:
 - [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php) and
 - [SDL_mixer](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/release-1.2.html)
 or
 - [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) and
 - [SDL2_mixer](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/)

and you have to adjust the include and library paths in the projects accordingly.

IMPORTANT: Do not forget to take care of version.h!
   By default it compiles for "Wolfenstein 3D v1.4 full GT/ID/Activision"!

TODOÂ´s:
------
 - Add support for any graphic resolution >= 320x200(40%)
 - Add latest fmopl sound
 - Fix some versions of Wolfenstein 3d.
 - Convert all the SDL Functions to not depends the SDL1.2/SDL2 Library
 - Remove all the features included on Wolf4SDL

Known bugs:
-----------
None for now :D

Troubleshooting:
----------------
 - If your frame rate is low, consider using the original screen resolution
   (--res 320 200) or lowering the sound quality (--samplerate 22050)
